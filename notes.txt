Goal:
* Setting pendulum.mass.position or pendulum.spring.displacement must be the
  same thing.
  We don't want a pendulum.position, because we don't want to duplicate every
  single internal value.
  
Open questions:
* parameters
* setting initial values from outside (like parameters, or as parameters)
* subsystems (e. g. vehicle with 4 wheels)
* visualization (also internal values: pwm values in a motor controller system,
  integral error in a PID controller)
