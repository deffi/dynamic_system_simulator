Next:
* Proper Arithmetic with Variables
* Direct creation of systems: var1.connect(systems.DeadTime(0.5, var2))
  * Arithmetic is something like that, but with static systems
* Better passing of the variable_wrapper, the system should do this itself
* Better handling of time functions
* Protection against overwriting a Variable instance with the value
* SystemRunner
* Recorder
* Connecting to constant/function input
* There should be different Variable subclasses instead of large elifs
* For the GUI, we'll need a way to reset the system, or we just have to create a
  a new instance for each run.
* We must be able to run different systems at different frequencies; e. g. a
  sample-and-hold system or a discrete-time controller running at 10 Hz, where
  the physics are still simulated at 100 Hz.

Cleanup:
* v1 + v2 + v3 should return sum([v1,v2,v3]), not sum([v1,sum([v2,v3])])
* A system can internally connect an output to a function of its input. But
  what happens if we get a cyclic connection?
  => Simulink calls this an "algebraic loop" and tries to solve it implicitly
     (if there is a solution). We'll have to detect this and react. It can be
     solved by inserting a unit delay somewhere.  
* Variable hierarchy:
  v1+v2+v3 should be sum([v1,v2,v3]), not sum([sum([v1, v2]), v3])
  This should be done in the __add__ method of the Sum backend, which means that
  the __add__ method of the Variable has to call __add__ of the backend. 
* Variable representation:
  v1 = 1
  v1_reference -> v1 = 1
  sum -> (v1 + v2 + v3) = 3
  sum_reference -> sum -> (v1 + v2 + v3) = 3

Goal:
* Setting pendulum.mass.position or pendulum.spring.displacement must be the
  same thing.
  We don't want a pendulum.position, because we don't want to duplicate every
  single internal value.
* We'll need a mechanism for enumerating (a) variables and (b) subsystems

Open questions:
* Make sure that all inputs are connected?
* Do we distinguish between internal values and outputs? Between inputs and
  outputs? Parameters and inputs?
* setting initial values from outside
* subsystems (e. g. vehicle with 4 wheels)
* visualization (also internal values: pwm values in a motor controller system,
  integral error in a PID controller)
